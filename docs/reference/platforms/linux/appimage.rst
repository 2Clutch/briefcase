Linux AppImage Support
======================

`AppImage <https://appimage.org>`__ provides a way for developers to provide
"native" binaries for Linux users. It allow packaging applications for any
common Linux based operating system, including Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, and
more. AppImages contain all the dependencies that cannot be assumed to
be part of each target system, and will run on most Linux distributions
without further modifications.
